I have been involved in various AI projects.

One of them is RAGFOOD, RAGFOOD was a local MCP that would use a context file with food data to provide information relevant to food, then I opened a Vector DB in Vercel and migrated the DB there and later on used AI gateway to use a cloud AI model and moved the application on the CLoude, in other words a full cloude MCP migration.

Another one is the digital twin, which I will use all this data as context to build my digital twin which will use AI to provide information about myself to others.


I have created a lot of project my most recent personal project is (Checks /docs)
